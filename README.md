# Game-of-Life
[Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton based on a few rules that determine states of given cells in the next generation of simulation.

This project is a Java implementation of this simple game/simulation.

UI features:
- setting size of the grid and size of cells
- setting up initial states of cells
- stopping and resuming simulation with possibility of changing cell states while stopped
- changing simulation speed
- changing modes (light/dark)
- displaying generations count
